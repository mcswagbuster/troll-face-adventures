"Notifiable Offences Recorded by the Police","Violence with Injury","Count","Offences","Apr12-Mar13","The total figure for England and Wales figures cannot be obtained simply by summing the totals for each country, due to the inclusion of British Transport Police.

Local authority figures do not always sum to the same national total as regional figures. This is because offences committed at airports cannot easily be mapped to local authorities.

Data is not available for local authorities in Somerset in 2012/13. This is because the whole county of Somerset is now covered by one Community Safety Partnership (CSP), and Crime Statistics are only available at CSP level.

The offence categories used differ from those used in previous years, due to a change in the headline offence groups used by the ONS in their Quarterly Crime Statistics bulletin from the year 2012/13 onwards."
